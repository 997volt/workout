/**
 * The migration array itself (ROADMAP B11).
 *
 * Every migration has a good test that upgrades a real database holding real rows — but
 * each of those tests passes its own migration object explicitly, and `ALL_MIGRATIONS`
 * is consumed only by the database builder. So a migration written, tested, and then
 * forgotten in the array left the whole suite green while crashing every install that
 * had data. These tests cannot be satisfied by a migration that is correct but
 * unregistered.
 *
 * The declared version is read from a database rather than from the `@Database`
 * annotation, which has binary retention and so is invisible to reflection — and the
 * runtime version is the one that matters anyway.
