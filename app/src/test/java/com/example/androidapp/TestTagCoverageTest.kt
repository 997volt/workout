/**
 * D4's gate: every tag applied in production has a test that asserts on it, or is on
 * [DEFERRED] — a list that may only shrink.
 *
 * DECISIONS.md's rule used to rest on trust, and the backlog grew while it did. This makes the
 * rule mechanical in both directions: a new tag without its test fails here, and paying a tag
 * off fails here until its name leaves the list, so the list tracks reality instead of
 * remembering it.
 *
 * The limit is deliberate: a test that asserts on an English literal rather than the tag is
 * invisible to this scan. That is the rule the tags exist to keep, and a gate that noticed it
 * would be reading the test's mind.
