/**
 * Weight handling (ROADMAP P1.3, and the groundwork for P1.9).
 *
 * Everything is stored as **whole grams in a `Long`**. That is a deliberate
 * choice over kilograms-as-`Double`:
 *
 *  - A `Double` cannot represent 0.1 kg exactly, so repeated edits (62.5, 63.75,
 *    ...) accumulate error, and "did they lift 100 or 100.00000001?" is not a
 *    question a training log should have to answer.
 *  - Grams give exact 0.5 kg and 1.25 kg steps with no rounding, and stay exact
 *    through unit changes, which is what makes P1.9 (kg/lb display) a pure
 *    presentation concern rather than a data conversion.
