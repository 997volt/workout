 * review — was missing. This is that comparison, as values rather than sentences, because
 * the wording belongs to the screen and the arithmetic belongs here.
 *
 * **Warm-up sets are excluded from both sides**, for the reason N17 excluded them from a
 * load series: a warm-up is not the work the plan prescribes, and letting one stand in for
 * the top set would flatter every comparison.
