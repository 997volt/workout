     * Two deliberate choices (ROADMAP P1.1a):
     *
     *  - **Secondary muscles are searched too.** They were not, so typing
     *    "forearms" missed every row where forearms were *secondary* — a dead end,
     *    because nothing on screen explained why a row the user could see was not
     *    found.
     *  - **The enum name is matched as well as the label.** `label` is user-facing
     *    text that localization translates, so a search keyed only on it quietly
     *    stops working in another language. `name` is locale-stable, so
     *    `FOREARMS` still matches "forearms" whatever the display language says.
