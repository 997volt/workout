 * truth for "which workout am I in", so passing an id through the back stack
 * would just create a second, staleable copy of that fact.
 *
 * It also owns creating a custom exercise here, mid-workout, because that is
 * where the gap is felt (ROADMAP N2): the new exercise is stored and appended to
 * the session in one step, so the user never leaves the picker.
 *
 * The same screen also fills a template (ROADMAP N3). Rather than a second picker,
 * the route carries an optional `templateId` and only the *destination* of the
 * chosen exercise changes — the search, the list and the create dialog are shared,
 * which is why the two paths cannot drift apart.
