 * tests and cannot silently depend on the machine's defaults.
 *
 * The zone matters more than it looks: history groups by *local* month, so a user
 * who travels sees a past workout in a different group. That is the right
 * behaviour, and it is why these take the zone rather than assuming UTC — see the
 * note in the roadmap about storing the offset that was true at the time.

     * Shared by the history list and home's Recent row, so one finished workout reads the same way
     * wherever it is listed.
