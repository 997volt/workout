/**
 * One exercise in a template, at an explicit [position] (ROADMAP N3).
 *
 * The foreign keys are the same shape `session_exercises` uses: deleting a template
 * cannot strand its rows, and an exercise referenced by a template cannot be
 * hard-deleted out from under it. Library exercises are soft-deleted, so `RESTRICT`
 * exists to catch a bug rather than to fire in normal use.
 *
 * [position] is stored rather than inferred, so reordering a template never depends
 * on row ids sorting usefully — the same reason a session exercise stores it.
