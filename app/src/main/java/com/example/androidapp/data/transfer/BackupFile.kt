/**
 * The on-disk backup format (ROADMAP P1.12).
 *
 * Because platform backup is off, this file is the **only** escape hatch: a lost
 * signing key, a signature change or a simple uninstall otherwise means permanent
 * loss. That shapes three decisions:
 *
 *  - **JSON, not CSV.** A CSV cannot represent this schema without flattening it,
 *    and a flattened export cannot be restored faithfully. The point of the file
 *    is a round trip, so it has to carry the real shape.
 *  - **Raw storage values, not domain shapes.** Enums are written by name and
 *    timestamps as epoch millis — exactly what the database holds. Re-deriving
 *    them through the domain layer on import would risk silently changing data.
 *  - **[schemaVersion] is checked.** A file written by a *newer* app is refused
 *    rather than partially read, because guessing at unknown fields is how a
 *    restore quietly loses a column.
 *
 * Soft-deleted rows are included on purpose: they are part of the data, and
 * dropping them would make the restored database differ from the original.
