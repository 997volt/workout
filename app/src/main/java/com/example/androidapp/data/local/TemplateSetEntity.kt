/**
 * One *planned* set on a template exercise (ROADMAP N14).
 *
 * A target, not a record: nothing verifies it, and the set the user actually logs is
 * a separate row in `set_entries` that is expected to differ. That is what keeps the
 * plan small — it describes the shape of a session rather than predicting it.
 *
 * Every target is nullable. A plan may say "3 sets of 5 at 100 kg" for one exercise
 * and "work up to a heavy single" for another, and the second has no weight to write
 * down: a zero would be a claim, and the app cannot check it.
 *
 * [setIndex] is stored rather than inferred, the same reason a session exercise's
 * position is: reordering must not depend on row ids sorting usefully.
