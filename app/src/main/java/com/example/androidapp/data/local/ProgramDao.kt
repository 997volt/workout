/**
 * Programs, their slots, and the weeks their occurrences were passed over (ROADMAP P3.3).
 *
 * Its own DAO rather than more methods on `TemplateDao`: a program orders templates the
 * way a template orders exercises, but it is a different aggregate — editing a program
 * never edits a plan, and the two only meet when a slot names one.
 *
 * The one query here that reaches outside the program tables is
 * [sessionsStartedBetween], and it has to: an occurrence is settled by the session that
 * was started from its template, so matching is a join between a program's slots and the
 * week's sessions. It lives here rather than in `WorkoutDao` because the program is the
 * thing being resolved; the session is the evidence.
