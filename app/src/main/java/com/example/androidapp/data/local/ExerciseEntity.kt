/**
 * A persisted library exercise (ROADMAP F5).
 *
 * The schema is deliberately written **sync-ready** even though storage is
 * local-only today:
 *
 *  - [id] is a stable string key (a slug for seeded rows, a UUID for
 *    user-created ones) rather than an autoincrement rowid, so a row can be
 *    created on any device without negotiating a key with a server.
 *  - [createdAt] / [updatedAt] / [deletedAt] are what a future sync (P4.9) needs
 *    to resolve conflicts and propagate deletions. [deletedAt] is a soft delete
 *    because a hard delete is invisible to a peer that has not synced yet.
 *
 * Retrofitting those three columns later would mean a migration *plus* a
 * backfill with invented timestamps, which is precisely the cost this avoids.
 * Nothing reads the sync columns yet — that is intentional, not dead weight.
