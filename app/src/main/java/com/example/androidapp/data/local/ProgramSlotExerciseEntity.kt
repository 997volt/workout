/**
 * One exercise of one program slot, and the rest and cue that slot prescribes for it
 * (ROADMAP P3.8).
 *
 * The parent of a slot's [ProgramSlotSetEntity] rows, mirroring the template's
 * `template_exercises`/`template_sets` split: the rest, the prescribed RPE and the cue belong to the
 * exercise, the set-by-set targets belong to the set, and denormalising the former onto every set row
 * would make one idea live in several places. The exercise is named by [exerciseId] rather than by a
 * `template_exercises` row, so the prescription survives editing the template (N16's living
 * template) — an exercise the template no longer has simply goes unread.
